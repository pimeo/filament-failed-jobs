## Retrying Failed Jobs
You can retry failed jobs each one separetely using the retry action next to each job, or bulk retry by selecting 
multiple jobs and then using the bulk options' menu. You can also use the global retry action to retry all failed jobs or 
jobs from a specific queue.

filter failed jobs.

- Queue
- Job
- Failed At

## Pruning Jobs
If you have too many stale failed jobs, You can use the global prune jobs action to prune stale failed jobs. 
This action will prompt you to input the hours to retain the failed jobs. Any failed jobs that are older than the 
given hours will be pruned.

For example, If you enter 12 hours, It will prune all failed jobs which are older than 12 hours.

## Customization
This plugin works out of the box and adds a `Failed Jobs` resource to your admin panel. You can customize the
display if needed.

### Remove connection column from index table
Most of the applications do not leverage more than one queue connection. So it would be clean to hide the connection
column in this case. You can do so by chaining the `hideConnectionOnIndex` method as below.

```php
FailedJobsPlugin::make()->hideConnectionOnIndex()
```

### Remove queue column from index table
Similarly, if your application only pushes to the default queue, You can hide the queue column by chaining the `hideQueueOnIndex` method as below.

```php
FailedJobsPlugin::make()->hideQueueOnIndex()
```

### Change filters layout
This plugin comes with a few filters to help you easily filter failed jobs. If you would like to change how the
filters are displayed, You can do so by chaining `filtersLayout` method which
accepts `Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout` parameter.

```php
FailedJobsPlugin::make()->filtersLayout(FiltersLayout::AboveContent)
```

### Authorization
You can restrict access to the failed jobs resource using the `authorize` method. This accepts a boolean or a closure that returns a boolean.

```php
FailedJobsPlugin::make()->authorize(fn () => auth()->user()->can('view-failed-jobs'))
```

### Navigation Group
You can change the navigation group using the `navigationGroup` method. This accepts a string, `UnitEnum` or `Closure`.

```php
FailedJobsPlugin::make()->navigationGroup('System')
```

### Navigation Label
You can customize the navigation label using the `navigationLabel` method.

```php
FailedJobsPlugin::make()->navigationLabel('Queue Failures')
```

### Navigation Icon
You can change the navigation icon using the `navigationIcon` method. This accepts a Heroicon string or a `Heroicon` enum value.

```php
FailedJobsPlugin::make()->navigationIcon('heroicon-o-exclamation-triangle')
```

### Navigation Sort Order
You can change the navigation sort order using the `navigationSort` method.

```php
FailedJobsPlugin::make()->navigationSort(10)
```

### Combined Example
You can chain multiple configuration methods together.

```php
FailedJobsPlugin::make()
    ->authorize(fn () => auth()->user()->isAdmin())
    ->navigationGroup('System')
    ->navigationLabel('Failed Jobs')
    ->navigationIcon('heroicon-o-queue-list')
    ->navigationSort(50)
```
